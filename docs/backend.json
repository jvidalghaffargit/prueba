    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure Authorization Independence, DBAC, and QAPs. User data and their configurations are stored under their respective user ID paths (`/users/{userId}`). This ensures clear ownership and simplifies security rules. Excel configurations are stored as subcollections under users, maintaining a clear 1:N relationship. Invoices are stored as a subcollection of Excel configurations, maintaining a clear 1:N relationship. This structure avoids hierarchical `get()` calls for authorization, promoting atomic operations and easier debugging. The Excel configuration id inside invoices enables efficient querying of invoices by configuration. \n\n**Authorization Independence:** The structure avoids `get()` calls in security rules by storing Excel configurations directly under user documents, eliminating the need to retrieve user information during invoice creation.  \n\n**QAPs Support:** List operations are secured because data is segregated by user ID. Rules can easily filter based on `request.auth.uid` to allow only the authenticated user to access their own data. The use of path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}/excelConfigurations/{excelConfigurationId}/invoices/{invoiceId}`) inherently supports secure list operations, as rules can be scoped to only allow listing resources owned by the authenticated user."
